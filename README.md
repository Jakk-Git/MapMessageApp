# MapMessageApp
NFC BRANCH

How to use the NFC app:
Have both users individually exchange keys with each other first. This is done by sending your key via android beam. This needs to be done every time they want to communicate with a different person.
Next, the users press the "KEY EXCHANGE MODE" button to switch to message exchange mode.
Once this is done, the users can type what they want into the message box at the top, and when they initiate android beam they can send their message.
