# MapMessageApp
NFC BRANCH

How to use the NFC app:
Have both users individually exchange keys with each other first. This needs to be done every time they want to communicate.
Next, the users press the "KEY EXCHANGE MODE" button to switch to message exchange mode.
Once this is done, the users can type what they want into the message box at the top, and when they initiate android beam they can send their message.

Currently the messages are not correctly decrypted. This hasn't yet been fixed because tablets we were given are too old to test my app on and
the tech center doesn't rent out tablets over the break.
If I get an opportunity to get another new phone before this is graded I will try to fix the decryption issue.
